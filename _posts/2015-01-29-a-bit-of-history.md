title: "A Bit of History..."

What's this site about? Where is it going? Who's writing it?

Racing radio controlled cars is a hobby of mine. I often get funny looks when I
mention this, but I like cars, I like speed, I like technology, and this has
all of those things!

I used to race before going to cégep (the Québec equivalent to college), which
was, um, in 1993. I was pretty decent at it, won some local club championships,
but it was on carpet and dirt ovals, which is easier to pick up than the
circuits they mostly run on here in the UK, almost everything changed (motor
and battery technology we could only dream of!), and, well, it was over 20
years ago!

Now, I'm a newbie again, but having quite a bit of fun again, especially now
that I'm not rebuilding ball diffs, truing motor comms, cleaning and filing
brushes, conditioning NiCad batteries, and so on. ;-)

I'll be putting up articles with tips, news I find interesting, report on
tracks and shops, and who knows what else...
