title: "Costs of Competitive 12th Scale Racing"
---

Everybody (in the UK, anyways!) knows that GT12 is the cheapest class to run,
right? Or is it? I've been taking a look around, comparing different kits...

Edited (2015-09-06) to add the Mardave Assassin Pro. Edited (2015-12-03) to add
the ORE TwelveGT and CRC Xti-WC.

I'll be leaving out electrics, as for all of the kits I'm looking at, they all
take the same, or close to (motors of the same brand/model usually all cost the
same, even if they have different number of turns).

Schumacher SupaStox GT
======================

| SupaStox GT Carbon | [£99.95](http://www.racing-cars.com/pp/Product_Category/Full_List/K157.html) |
| Diff Kit | [£29.99](http://www.racing-cars.com/pp/Product_Category/Full_List/U4633.html) |
| Low Pivot Conversion | [£25.00](http://www.racing-cars.com/pp/Product_Category/Full_List/U4716.html) |
| Roll Damper Conversion | [£19.99](http://www.racing-cars.com/pp/Product_Category/Full_List/U4647.html) |
| Pod Balance Weight | [£7.99](http://www.racing-cars.com/pp/Product_Category/Full_List/U4646.html) |
| Motor Spacers | [£7.99](http://www.racing-cars.com/pp/Product_Category/Full_List/U4709.html) |
| Total | £190.91 |

I've been a bit gentle, as some might go for the Zen diff
([£49.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/zen-racing-schuma
cher-superstox-complete-rear-axlediff-bolt-p-1164)) instead of the Schumacher
one, to allow fitting JFT tyres, which not only adds another £20, but also
needs (at least) another set of rear, since the kit provided ones won't fit, as
well as £10-20 of other parts (spur gear, bearings, spacers, etc), getting it
well past £200!

Mardave Assassin Pro
====================

| Assassin Pro (w/LiPo Brass Weight) | [£164.95](http://mardave.co.uk/catalog/product/view/id/4962/) |
| 2mm Motor Spacer Plate | [£9.95](http://www.actionmodelcentre.com/proddetail.asp?prod=MAR-V8NM2) |
| Green Front Springs | [£2.65](http://mardave.co.uk/hop-ups/assassin/example-product-5483.html) |
| Medium Rear Springs | [£1.65](http://mardave.co.uk/hop-ups/assassin/example-product-5461.html) |
| 1.5deg Camber Strap | [£5.95](http://mardave.co.uk/hop-ups/assassin/example-product-5534.html) |
| Total | £185.15 |

The Assassin really benefits from Mardave's frequent and quite generous deals.
For example, when I looked, it came with a free LiPo brass weight (normally
[£14.99](http://mardave.co.uk/hop-ups/assassin/example-product-5489.html),
which would have brought the total price to £200.14). I was a bit surprised
that using a 2mm motor spacer was recommended even with the Pro model,
considering it comes with an offset pod? I didn't include any in the price, but
small extra balance weights are commonly needed.

Different tyres to the kit ones have also been recommended to me, but I didn't
include that for fairness, as I feel it's still likely that you might need
different tyres with the other kits.

ORE TwelveGT
============

| TwelveGT Fully Upgraded Kit | [£139.00](http://www.oreracing.co.uk/apps/webstore/products/show/6286058) |
| Total | £139.00 |

If you want to run Contacts wheels/tyres, the ORE TwelveGT is a pretty
interesting combination, being *truly* fully upgraded, and sporting an unusual
design that has a fairly low centre of mass. In practice, a bit of lead weight
ballast is going to be needed, but not enough to warrant an under-LiPo brass
weight, I'm told, so all told, this is the cheapest one by far, it would seem!

If you'd prefer to run JFT wheels/tyres, ORE sells a kit without axles and
wheels, but it's a bit of a "death by a thousand cuts" to put this together.

| TwelveGT Fully Upgraded Kit (less axle and wheels) | [£124.00](http://www.oreracing.co.uk/apps/webstore/products/show/6286046) |
| Zen GT12 Rear Diff Kit | [£39.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/gt12-rear-diff-p-1083) |
| Rear Axle Bearings | [£5.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/112-rear-axle-bearings-14x38-flanged-5pcs-p-677) |
| Zen Left Clamping Hub | [£11.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/112-left-clamping-hub-positive-wheel-lock-p-620) |
| Zen Left Hub Spider | [£6.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/112-left-hub-spider-positive-lock-p-621) |
| Rear Axle Spacer | £2.00 |
| Hub Screw Set | [£1.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/112-positive-lock-diff-hub-screw-set-p-624) |
| Spur Gear | [£4.49](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/66t-48dp-spur-gear-p-644) |
| Front Wheel Bearings | [£4.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/112-front-axle-bearings-18x516-flanged-4pcs-p-678) |
| Front Wheel Spacers | [£1.50](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/gt12-front-wheel-spacer-p-1066) |
| Rear JFT Tyres | [£5.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/gt12-jft-foam-shore-lilac-mounted-rear-tyres-1pr-p-1095) |
| Front JFT Tyres | [£6.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/gt12-jft-foam-shore-violet-mounted-front-tyres-1pr-p-1096) |
| Total | £216.91 |

This brings it from one of the cheapest, to one of the most expensive! If you
really want to run JFT wheels/tyres, you might want to look at the...

Zen-Racing RSGT12
=================

| RSGT12 Race | [£169.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/zen-racing-zen-rsgt12-race-p-1099) |
| LiPo Brass Weight | [£14.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/gt12-lipo-brass-weight-90g-p-1093) |
| Nerf Wing Spacers | [£2.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/gt12-nerf-wing-spacers-p-1084) |
| Carbon Front Shims | [£11.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/gt12l4-carbon-front-shim-set-p-1128) |
| Total | £199.96 |

The basic starting price here is higher, but not as many upgrades are
necessary. The brass weight yields the best weight distribution, putting it
low, in the centre, but one could save some money with use regular lead
weights, or some other cheaper brass plate. The offset rear pod obviates the
need for motor spacers or a pod balance weight (both of which add weight right
where you don't want it, unsuspended), which makes the whole thing simpler to
set up and run (note that the Pro version of the Mardave Assassin also has an
offset pod).

I included the carbon front shims set, which isn't strictly necessary either,
as the Race kit includes washers for setting the ride height, but the carbon
shims are so much more convenient! Changing the ride height trackside with the
washers would be rather annoying, for example. I also included them to lead on
to the next kit...

XRay X12 2015
=============

| XRay X12 2015 | [£199.99](http://www.rcdisco.com/part-info.php?partNo=XR370004) |
| Front Tyres | [£3.49](http://www.racing-cars.com/pp/Product_Category/Wheels_Tyres_and_Inserts/JT32FA.html) |
| Rear Tyres | [£4.00](http://www.racing-cars.com/pp/Product_Category/Wheels_Tyres_and_Inserts/JT30RA.html) |
| Total | £207.48 |

The title didn't say "competitive GT12 racing", did it? Strictly speaking, this
is the most expensive kit, although, impressively, still less than the SupaStox
kit above with a Zen axle! But anyone who's had an XRay car in their hands can
tell that we're looking at quite a different level of quality (and
performance!) than even the best GT12 cars have! That's not the fault of these
cars, but they have to work within the limitations of the GT12 rules (such as
the price limit on the basic kit), and, despite their popularity in the UK, are
of fairly limited production in comparison (so costs are higher).

For that price, the XRay includes all the bits the other do, like all the ride
height adjustment bits. Even if you'd want to upgrade the car, there's very
little to upgrade (there's a [graphite
axle](http://www.rcdisco.com/part-info.php?partNo=XR375010) and some more rigid
[graphite suspensions
parts](http://www.rcdisco.com/part-info.php?partNo=XR372113), not much else).

The tyres aren't included in the kit, but for some reason, LMP12 tyres can be
had for cheaper than GT12 ones? They also last a bit longer than GT12 tyres, as
the main factors for tyre wear are the surface pressure (weight per area) and
how much they're worked, and LMP12 cars have the edge in all those ways, being
lighter, having a bigger tyre contact area, and a lower centre of mass. On the
other hand competitive LMP12 racers tend to true their tyres quite small!
Personally, I'd true tyres on the large side, use them for club racing, and
when they wear down, set them aside for bigger events (after a skim on the
truer).

CRC Xti-WC
==========

| CRC Xti-WC | [£159.99](http://www.zen-racing.co.uk/catalog/product_info.php/xti-112-road-car-kit-p-1644) |
| Front Tyres | [£3.49](http://www.racing-cars.com/pp/Product_Category/Wheels_Tyres_and_Inserts/JT32FA.html) |
| Rear Tyres | [£4.00](http://www.racing-cars.com/pp/Product_Category/Wheels_Tyres_and_Inserts/JT30RA.html) |
| Total | £167.48 |

This is the [12th scale World
Champion](http://events.redrc.net/2014/10/rheinard-new-112-world-champion/)
*and* almost the cheapest kit (only the Contacts version of the ORE TwelveGT is
cheaper in my comparison). I'm not really sure what more to say here!

Conclusion
==========

The most obvious thing that appears to me is that the Zen RSGT12 Race isn't as
expensive as it seems, for a front runner car. But another, more surprising
finding is that a front running GT12 car doesn't seem that much cheaper than
running a very good LMP12 car would be!

But one thing that GT12 still has is a lower cost to entry: while you can get a
cheaper GT12 than those, and have a good deal of fun at club level, the
cheapest LMP12 is about the same price as a very good one. That's good news if
you're looking for a top car, but if you're trying to save some coin and you're
more focused on having fun than being competitive, a GT12 can be cheaper in
that case...

Think of what kind of racer you are and what you'd like to be doing with your
racing, and you can find the right class for you.
