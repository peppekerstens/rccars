title: Pro10 Rules Around the World
summary: 1/10 scale pan car racing from around the world.
---

These are summaries (and translations) of rules used for 1/10 scale pan cars,
usually 235mm wide (often known as Pro10), but also some 200mm wide cars (for
example, Swiss GT and Danish Le-Mans Serie). I also have an unofficial copy of
the [BRCA GT10 rules](../brca-gt10-rules/) on this website.

17.5T blinky 2S.

# [Moravian Le Mans Series](http://www.lemans-serie.cz/report/propositions-2016.html)

They have a few more classes (such as GT2, 4wd touring cars with GT shells),
but I'm only translating/summarising the 1:10 pan car rules here, and ignoring
irrelevant bits.

## Common Rules

- Cars should be 1:10 scale. Specifically, all standard cars sold as 1:10,
  Pro10 up to 240mm wide.
- Shells of LMP, GT, and TC types, must be realistically painted, in such a way
  to be opaque.
- Batteries up to a nominal voltage of 7.4V.
- Only rear wheel drive is allowed.

## LMP1

- Class intended for sports prototypes of Le Mans type, with unrealistic
  special purpose bodywork.
- Maximum width: 240mm.
- Open motor.
- Open tyre width and foam compound.
- Shells of Le Mans Prototype style, aimed at racing. For example, too low or
  wide profile, usually with a "shovel" behind the wing, and generally
  disproportional shapes compared with the real cars.
- Rigid rear axle.

## LMP2

- Class intended for realistically modelled sports prototypes, of Le Mans or GT
  type.
- Maximum width: 200mm (nominal, deviations are found from different
  manufacturers).
- Motor: 10.5T or higher winds.
- Open foam compounds, maximum width of 50mm.
- Realistic body of Le Mans Prototype or GT type.

## GT

- Class intended for GT sports cars.
- Maximum width: 200mm (nominal, deviations are found from different
  manufacturers).
- Motor: 21.5T with boost, or 17.5T blinky.
- Maximum width of rear tyres: 30mm with boost/turbo, 50mm in blinky.
- Shells of realistic GT type.
- This class allows independent rear suspension, and sealed oil dampers both
  front and rear.
